                <br />
                <div>
                  Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`)
                  characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string
                  interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special
                  constructs called tagged templates.

            <h3>2. Difference between var, let and const :-</h3>
            <br />
            <div>
              <b>Var:</b> Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled.
              There are issues associated with variables declared with var,
              though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare
              variables to emerge.
              <br />
              <b>Let:</b> let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no
              surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. Let is
              block scope.
              <br />
              <b>Const:</b> Variables declared with the const maintain constant
              values. const declarations share some similarities with let
              declarations. Const is block scope too.

            <h3>3. Difference between map, forEach, filter,find :-</h3>
            <br />
            <div>
              <b>ForEach:</b> Foreach takes a callback function and run that
              callback function on each element of array one by one.
              <br />
              <b>Filter:</b> The main difference between forEach and filter is
              that forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback
              but filter executes the callback and check its return value.
              <br />
              <b>Map : </b> Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run
              it against every element on the array but whats makes it unique is
              it generate a new array based on your existing array.
              <br />
              <b>Reduce : </b> As the name already suggest reduce method of the
              array object is used to reduce the array to one single value.

              4. Difference between arrow function and regular function :-
            </h3>
            <br />
            <div>
              <b>Arrow function:</b> Arrow function — also called fat arrow
              function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more
              concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both
              regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar
              manner, there are certain differences between them.
              <br />
              <b>Regular function:</b> We can call both function declaration and
              expression as Normal/Regular Function
